# Anomaly Detection on Time Series: An Evaluation of Deep Learning Methods

The goal of this repository is to evaluate multivariate time-series anomaly detection algorithms on a common set of datasets discussed in the paper:

A. Garg, W. Zhang, J. Samaran, R. Savitha and C. -S. Foo, "An Evaluation of Anomaly Detection and Diagnosis in Multivariate Time Series," in IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, doi: 10.1109/TNNLS.2021.3105827.

Raw signal passes as is. Base method for benchmarking.

### PCA
PCA is used for lossy reconstruction. 

### Univar Auto-encoder
Channel-wise auto-encoders for each channel.

## Data sets and how to get them

### Swat
This data set contains 11 days of continuous operation in a water treatment testbed. 7 days’ worth of data was collected 
under normal operation while 4 days’ worth of data was collected with attack scenarios.  During the data collection, all 
network traffic, sensor and actuator data were collected.
To obtain the data one must make a request by filling out 
[this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfnbjv7ZnDNmV_5ge7OfUc_O_h5yUnj708TFL8dD3o3Yoj9Fw/viewform)
Download the files "SWaT_Dataset_Normal_v1.xlsx" and "SWaT_Dataset_Attack_v0.xlsx" and put it in the location <root-of-the-project>/data/raw/swat/raw

### Wadi
Similar to Swat this data set consists of 16 days of continuous operation, of which 14 days’ worth of data from a water 
distribution testbed was collected under normal operation and 2 days with attack scenarios.
After submitting the same 
[form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfnbjv7ZnDNmV_5ge7OfUc_O_h5yUnj708TFL8dD3o3Yoj9Fw/viewform) as for swat, 
you will receive a link to access a google drive.
Then both csv tables that can be found in the 02_WADI Dataset_19 Nov 2017 folder must be placed at the following 
location: <root-of-the-project>/data/raw/wadi/raw

### Damadics
This data set contains data from actuators collected over several days at the Lublin Sugar Factory.
Data can be downloaded from this [website](https://iair.mchtr.pw.edu.pl/Damadics), each file contains the data acquired 
during one day and the data from October 29th to November 22, 2001 should be downloaded and placed at the following 
location: <root-of-the-project>/data/raw/damadics/raw

### Skab
The Skoltech Anomaly Benchmark testbed consists of a water circulation system and its control system, along with a data-processing and storage system. Examples of the type of anomalies induced include partial valve closures, connecting shaft imbalance, reduced motor power, cavitation and flow disturbances. Train and test splits are provided by the authors. 
The dataset is available at https://www.kaggle.com/yuriykatser/skoltech-anomaly-benchmark-skab/version/1

### Smap and Msl
Get data

You can get the public datasets (SMAP and MSL) using:

wget https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/telemanom/data.zip && unzip data.zip && rm data.zip

cd data && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/khundman/telemanom/master/labeled_anomalies.csv

Place the folder smap_msl under <root-of-the-project>/data/raw/

### Smd
SMD (Server Machine Dataset) is the folder here: 
https://github.com/NetManAIOps/OmniAnomaly/tree/master/ServerMachineDataset

Place the folder 'ServerMachineDataset' at the location <root-of-the-project>/data/raw/

## Usage
Put all the datasets in the data/raw/ directory. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/astha-chem/mvts-ano-eval.git
conda create -n mvtsenv python=3.6.8
source activate mvtsenv
python3 -m pip3 install --user --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt --user

# cpu only
# conda install pytorch==1.2.0 torchvision==0.4.0 cpuonly -c pytorch
python3 setup.py install
get_datasets.sh
python3 main.py
python3 metrics_expts.py
```
